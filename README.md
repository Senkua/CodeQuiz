# CodeQuiz

## Description

- My motivation to make this was the fun learning element of it all.
- I built this project to test the wits of some that are looking for a challenge! as well as to learn more about javascript in the process of it.
- It lets you test your coding knowledge in a timed quiz.
- I learnt more in depth on topics on javascript thanks to this!
